I am a student at the Singapore Institute of Technology (SIT), interested in data, technology, and applied learning.  
This website showcases some of my past projects, a data visualization example, and my reflection on using GenAI tools.


- Final Year Project (or other project) overview.
- One data visualization project from my student life.
- Reflection on how GenAI supported the development of this webpage.
