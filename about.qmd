# Project Overview

I was a Temasek Polytechnic alumni and my Final Year Project focused on improving inventory management and overall supply chain efficiency.  
Together with my group mates, we looked for practical ways to reduce delays, avoid stockouts, and make day‑to‑day operations smoother for businesses.

- Time period: Aug 2022 – Mar 2023  
- Team: Group of 4  
- Role: Data gathering, analysis, and helping to design the proposed workflow

## How the project was done

1. **Data collection and research**  
   We reviewed articles and case studies on supply chain optimisation and spoke with staff to understand pain points such as inaccurate stock levels and manual tracking.

2. **Exploring solutions and challenges**  
   We compared different ideas (better barcode usage, clearer reorder rules, simple tracking tools) while considering cost, training, and how easily they could fit into existing processes. 

3. **Showcase room concept**  
   To present our ideas, we designed a small “template showcase room” layout that demonstrated how the proposed solutions might look in a real storeroom or warehouse, using example shelves, labels, and simple process diagrams.

## Key Takeaways

- Even small changes in workflow and visibility can make a big difference to inventory accuracy.  
- Technical solutions only work if they match how people actually work on the ground, so communication with end‑users is important.
