# Project Overview

I am a Temasek Polytechnic alumni and my Final Year Project explored ways to improve inventory management and overall supply chain efficiency.  
We wanted to reduce delays, avoid stockouts, and make daily operations smoother for businesses.

- Focus: Practical ideas to improve inventory workflows and tracking.
- Time period: Aug 2022 – Mar 2023
- Team: Group of 4

# Methodology (how we did it)

1. **Data collection and research**  
   We studied existing supply chain practices and gathered information from reports, sites, and interviews to understand common problems.

2. **Challenges of implementing solutions**  
   We had to balance cost, staff training, and how easily new ideas could fit into existing systems.

3. **Template showcase room**  
   We built a small “showcase room” concept to demonstrate how our proposed solutions could look and work in a real setting, using layouts and simple visuals.
