# A Visualization project I made together with my Group mate

This page presents one **quantitative data visualization** I created during my studies.

## Stockie

You can view the full code for this visualization on my
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/Hexteris/Stock-Analysis-Y1T1).

## My group and I created a stock visualization web app:
  
- The top panel tracks my total number of trades, realised profit and loss, and win rate over the semester.
- The line charts show daily price movements and indicators for different stocks.
- The bottom panel visualizes my buy and sell points, which helped me reflect on my trading decisions.
