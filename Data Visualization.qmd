title: "Data Visualization"

This page shares one visualization work that my group and I created during our student life.  
The example uses a dashboard to visualise quantitative stock data with multiple graphs.

## Stockie – Stock Analysis Dashboard

You can view the full code for this visualization on our  
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/Hexteris/Stock-Analysis-Y1T1).

## What is visualised

- The summary section at the top shows numeric indicators such as number of trades, realised profit or loss, and win rate for the period.  
- The time‑series charts display stock prices, indicators, and trading volume over time, so each point on the graph represents a specific numerical value on a given date.  
- The bottom chart marks our buy and sell points, allowing us to see exactly where trades happened along the price curve.

## How we built it

The dashboard uses Python and Plotly for interactive charts. Here's a sample:

```python
import plotly.graph_objects as go

# Create candlestick chart
fig = go.Figure(data=[go.Candlestick(
    x=df['Date'],
    open=df['Open'],
    high=df['High'],
    low=df['Low'],
    close=df['Close']
)])
fig.show()
```

## Context

Our group created this dashboard to analyse stock trends.
We chose a line‑based time‑series layout because it clearly shows trends and volatility over time, which is important for stock data.  
Placing summary statistics above and detailed graphs below lets us quickly check overall results first, then drill down into individual trades to see whether our entries and exits were well‑timed or need improvement.
